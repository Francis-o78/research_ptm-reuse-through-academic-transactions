In this paper, we propose a novel system named Disp R-CNN for 3D object detection from stereo images. Many recent works solve this problem by first recovering point clouds with disparity estimation and then apply a 3D detector. The disparity map is computed for the entire image, which is costly and fails to leverage category-specific prior. In contrast, we design an instance disparity estimation network (iDispNet) that predicts disparity only for pixels on objects of interest and learns a category-specific shape prior for more accurate disparity estimation. To address the challenge from scarcity of disparity annotation in training, we propose to use a statistical shape model to generate dense disparity pseudo-ground-truth without the need of LiDAR point clouds, which makes our system more widely applicable. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that, when LiDAR ground-truth is not used at training time, Disp R-CNN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods based on stereo input by 20 percent in terms of average precision for all categories. The code and pseudo-ground-truth data are available at the project page: https://github.com/zju3dv/disprcnn .
Methods based on convolutional neural networks have improved the performance of biomedical image segmentation. However, most of these methods cannot efficiently segment objects of variable sizes and train on small and biased datasets, which are common for biomedical use cases. While methods exist that incorporate multi-scale fusion approaches to address the challenges arising with variable sizes, they usually use complex models that are more suitable for general semantic segmentation problems. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called Multi-Scale Residual Fusion Network (MSRF-Net), which is specially designed for medical image segmentation. The proposed MSRF-Net is able to exchange multi-scale features of varying receptive fields using a Dual-Scale Dense Fusion (DSDF) block. Our DSDF block can exchange information rigorously across two different resolution scales, and our MSRF sub-network uses multiple DSDF blocks in sequence to perform multi-scale fusion. This allows the preservation of resolution, improved information flow and propagation of both high- and low-level features to obtain accurate segmentation maps. The proposed MSRF-Net allows to capture object variabilities and provides improved results on different biomedical datasets. Extensive experiments on MSRF-Net demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the cutting-edge medical image segmentation methods on four publicly available datasets. We achieve the Dice Coefficient (DSC) of 0.9217, 0.9420, and 0.9224, 0.8824 on Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset, and ISIC-2018 skin lesion segmentation challenge dataset respectively. We further conducted generalizability tests and achieved DSC of 0.7921 and 0.7575 on CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, respectively.
Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is clinically desirable because it reduces the radiation dose to patients. However, the quality of LDCT images is often suboptimal because of the inevitable strong quantum noise. Because of their unprecedented success in computer vision, deep learning (DL)-based techniques have been used for LDCT denoising. Despite DL models' promising ability to remove noise, researchers have observed that the resolution of DL-denoised images is compromised, which decreases their clinical value. To mitigate this problem, in this work, we developed a more effective denoiser by introducing a high-resolution network (HRNet). HRNet consists of multiple branches of subnetworks that extract multiscale features that are fused together later, which substantially enhances the quality of the generated features and improves denoising performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the introduced HRNet-based denoiser outperformed the benchmarked U-Net–based denoiser, as it provided superior image resolution preservation and comparable, if not better, noise suppression. Quantitative evaluation in terms of root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs)/structure similarity index (SSIM) showed that the HRNet-based denoiser improve these values from 113.80/0.550 (LDCT) to 55.24/0.745 (HRNet), which outperformed the 59.87/0.712 for the U-Net–based denoiser.
In recent years, many agriculture-related problems have been evaluated with the integration of artificial intelligence techniques and remote sensing systems. Specifically, in fruit detection problems, several recent works were developed using Deep Learning (DL) methods applied in images acquired in different acquisition levels. However, the increasing use of anti-hail plastic net cover in commercial orchards highlights the importance of terrestrial remote sensing systems. Apples are one of the most highly-challenging fruits to be detected in images, mainly because of the target occlusion problem occurrence. Additionally, the introduction of high-density apple tree orchards makes the identification of single fruits a real challenge. To support farmers to detect apple fruits efficiently, this paper presents an approach based on the Adaptive Training Sample Selection (ATSS) deep learning method applied to close-range and low-cost terrestrial RGB images. The correct identification supports apple production forecasting and gives local producers a better idea of forthcoming management practices. The main advantage of the ATSS method is that only the center point of the objects is labeled, which is much more practicable and realistic than bounding-box annotations in heavily dense fruit orchards. Additionally, we evaluated other object detection methods such as RetinaNet, Libra Regions with Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), Cascade R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Feature Selective Anchor-Free (FSAF), and High-Resolution Network (HRNet). The study area is a highly-dense apple orchard consisting of Fuji Suprema apple fruits (Malus domestica Borkh) located in a smallholder farm in the state of Santa Catarina (southern Brazil). A total of 398 terrestrial images were taken nearly perpendicularly in front of the trees by a professional camera, assuring both a good vertical coverage of the apple trees in terms of heights and overlapping between picture frames. After, the high-resolution RGB images were divided into several patches for helping the detection of small and/or occluded apples. A total of 3119, 840, and 2010 patches were used for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method’s generalization capability was assessed by applying simulated image corruptions to the test set images with different severity levels, including noise, blurs, weather, and digital processing. Experiments were also conducted by varying the bounding box size (80, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 pixels) in the image original for the proposed approach. Our results showed that the ATSS-based method slightly outperformed all other deep learning methods, between 2.4% and 0.3%. Also, we verified that the best result was obtained with a bounding box size of 160 × 160 pixels. The proposed method was robust regarding most of the corruption, except for snow, frost, and fog weather conditions. Finally, a benchmark of the reported dataset is also generated and publicly available.
The working environment of autonomous driving and robot navigation is so complex and dynamic that a single type of sensor is insufficient for performing object detection. Thus, in many perception schemes, the LiDAR-camera fusion strategy is preferred. However, the performance of a LiDAR-camera fusion heavily relies on a set of accurately calibrated extrinsic parameters. We propose PSNet, an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) for calibration; this is the first calibration network to use parallel subnetworks to obtain multiresolution features and fuse them adaptively to encourage robustness against different initial error ranges. The method has three key characteristics: (i) Addition of a downsampling block to improve suitability for sparse projected depth maps; (ii) Connection of the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel to obtain multiresolution features that are spatially more precise and contain richer semantic information; (iii) Fusion of multiresolution streams by the multiscale feature aggregation module. The network corrects errors from initial calibration to the ground truth online, rather than directly obtaining the accurate parameters. We evaluated our model on the KITTI datasets and it outperformed other CNN-based methods. In addition, extensive experiments evaluating the model with untrained and unfamiliar datasets demonstrated that our method exhibited good generalization ability.
Background and Objective: Open-source deep learning toolkits are one of the driving forces for developing medical image segmentation models that are essential for computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment procedures. Existing toolkits mainly focus on fully supervised segmentation that assumes full and accurate pixel-level annotations are available. Such annotations are time-consuming and difficult to acquire for segmentation tasks, which makes learning from imperfect labels highly desired for reducing the annotation cost. We aim to develop a new deep learning toolkit to support annotation-efficient learning for medical image segmentation, which can accelerate and simplify the development of deep learning models with limited annotation budget, e.g., learning from partial, sparse or noisy annotations.Methods: Our proposed toolkit named PyMIC is a modular deep learning library for medical image segmentation tasks. In addition to basic components that support development of high-performance models for fully supervised segmentation, it contains several advanced components that are tailored for learning from imperfect annotations, such as loading annotated and unannounced images, loss functions for unannotated, partially or inaccurately annotated images, and training procedures for co-learning between multiple networks, etc. PyMIC is built on the PyTorch framework and supports development of semi-supervised, weakly supervised and noise-robust learning methods for medical image segmentation.Results: We present several illustrative medical image segmentation tasks based on PyMIC: (1) Achieving competitive performance on fully supervised learning; (2) Semi-supervised cardiac structure segmentation with only 10% training images annotated; (3) Weakly supervised segmentation using scribble annotations; and (4) Learning from noisy labels for chest radiograph segmentation.Conclusions: The PyMIC toolkit is easy to use and facilitates efficient development of medical image segmentation models with imperfect annotations. It is modular and flexible, which enables researchers to develop high-performance models with low annotation cost. The source code is available at:https://github.com/HiLab-git/PyMIC
Currently, GPS is by far the most popular global localization method. However, it is not always reliable or accurate in all environments. SLAM methods enable local state estimation but provide no means of registering the local map to a global one, which can be important for inter-robot collaboration or human interaction. In this work, we present a real-time method for utilizing semantics to globally localize a robot using only egocentric 3D semantically labelled LiDAR and IMU as well as top-down RGB images obtained from satellites or aerial robots. Additionally, as it runs, our method builds a globally registered, semantic map of the environment. We validate our method on KITTI as well as our own challenging datasets, and show better than 10 m accuracy, a high degree of robustness, and the ability to estimate the scale of a top-down map on the fly if it is initially unknown.
With the increasing volume of maritime traffic, the need for maritime surveillance is also increasing. In this situation, unlike the land environment where various data sets are built, the marine environment lacks data, so the progress of technology research is insufficient. Several object detection methods have been proposed and show excellent performance in areas where sufficient data is secured, but performance verification of existing techniques has not been performed on marine images. In this paper, we compare the performance of marine object detection in various marine images with the latest object detection methods and propose an object detection method suitable for marine environments.
Crop type mapping is an indispensable topic in the agricultural field and plays an important role in agricultural intelligence. In crop type mapping, most studies focus on time series models. However, in our experimental area, the images of the crop harvest stage can be obtained from single temporal remote sensing images. Only using single temporal data for crop type mapping can reduce the difficulty of dataset production. In addition, the model of single temporal crop type mapping can also extract the spatial features of crops more effectively. In this work, we linked crop type mapping with 2D semantic segmentation and designed CACPU-Net based on single-source and single-temporal autumn Sentinel-2 satellite images. First, we used a shallow convolutional neural network, U-Net, and introduced channel attention mechanism to improve the model’s ability to extract spectral features. Second, we presented the Dice to compute loss together with cross-entropy to mitigate the effects of crop class imbalance. In addition, we designed the CP module to additionally focus on hard-to-classify pixels. Our experiment was conducted on BeiDaHuang YouYi of Heilongjiang Province, which mainly grows rice, corn, soybean, and other economic crops. On the dataset we collected, through the 10-fold cross-validation experiment under the 8:1:1 dataset splitting scheme, our method achieved 93.74% overall accuracy, higher than state-of-the-art models. Compared with the previous model, our improved model has higher classification accuracy on the parcel boundary. This study provides an effective end-to-end method and a new research idea for crop type mapping. The code and the trained model are available on https://github.com/mooneed/CACPU-Net.
We present a new learning-based framework to recover vehicle pose in SO(3) from a single RGB image. In contrast to previous works that map local appearance to observation angles, we explore a progressive approach by extracting meaningful Intermediate Geometrical Representations (IGRs) to estimate egocentric vehicle orientation. This approach features a deep model that transforms perceived intensities to IGRs, which are mapped to a 3D representation encoding object orientation in the camera coordinate system. Core problems are what IGRs to use and how to learn them more effectively. We answer the former question by designing IGRs based on an interpolated cuboid that derives from primitive 3D annotation readily. The latter question motivates us to incorporate geometry knowledge with a new loss function based on a projective invariant. This loss function allows unlabeled data to be used in the training stage to improve representation learning. Without additional labels, our system outperforms previous monocular RGB-based methods for joint vehicle detection and pose estimation on the KITTI benchmark, achieving performance even comparable to stereo methods.
